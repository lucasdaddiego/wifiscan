# wifiscan — terminal WiFi survey & channel planner (Swift / CoreWLAN).
# `make` builds wifiscan.app into ~/Applications and a `wifiscan` launcher on PATH.
#
# Why an .app bundle? macOS gates Wi-Fi SSIDs behind Location Services and only
# grants it to an app with its own identity. A bare CLI has none, so its request
# can't be attributed to the terminal reliably. Running the binary *inside* a
# signed .app gives the process the bundle's identity, so "wifiscan" appears in
# Location Services on its own — independent of which terminal you launch it from.

# Optional machine-local overrides (git-ignored) — e.g. SIGN := <your cert>.

# Signing identity. Ad-hoc ("-") by default — but ad-hoc has no stable identity, so
# macOS ties the Location grant to the exact build and forgets it on every rebuild.

# Signing"), then build with:  make SIGN="Your Cert Name"
