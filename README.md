A terminal **Wi‑Fi survey & channel planner** for modern macOS, driven straight off
**CoreWLAN**. One scan, one screen: every nearby network with its **name, power,
SNR, channel, band, width and security** — sortable on any column, with a live
**channel‑congestion map** and a **"cleanest channel" recommendation per band** so
you can pick the best channel for each of your access points.

A single self‑contained Swift binary. No Homebrew, no Python, no `pip`, no
third‑party packages.

## Features

- **Full neighbour survey** — SSID, RSSI (dBm), SNR, channel, band (2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz),
  channel width (20/40/80/160 MHz) and security (Open / WEP / WPA / WPA2 / WPA3 /
  transition).
- **Sort by any column** live — power, SNR, channel, name, band, width, security;
  press a key again to reverse.
- **Channel‑congestion map** — a power‑weighted occupancy bar per channel, per band,
  that accounts for channel‑bonding overlap.
- **"Cleanest channel" recommendations** per band, using energy‑weighted
  interference scoring (not just AP counts).
- **Colour‑coded signal** bars and dBm, from bright‑green (excellent) to red (poor).
- **Live auto‑refresh** with adjustable interval, plus on‑demand rescan.
- **Band filters** (2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz / all) and scrolling for crowded areas.
- **Scriptable** — `--once`, `--json` (pipe into `jq`), and `--diag` modes.
- **Single static binary**, packaged as a signed `.app`; **zero dependencies**.

## Why a custom tool?

On **macOS 14.4+ Apple removed the `airport` CLI**, and there's no maintained, free
TUI scanner that returns neighbour RSSI / channel / width. The only API that still
does is **CoreWLAN** (`CWWiFiClient`), which `wifiscan` drives directly in Swift —
so it works on the latest macOS with nothing to install.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (built & tested on **macOS 26 / Apple Silicon**; targets macOS 12+).
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** for `swiftc` — `xcode-select --install`.
- That's it. No Homebrew formulae, no Swift packages.

## Install

```sh
make            # build wifiscan.app into ~/Applications + a `wifiscan` launcher on ~/.bin
make clean      # remove both
```

`make` compiles an optimised, fully‑stripped binary (no debug info), embeds an
`Info.plist`, ad‑hoc code‑signs it inside **`~/Applications/wifiscan.app`**, and
symlinks a **`wifiscan`** command into **`~/.bin`**.

Make sure `~/.bin` is on your `PATH`:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Then run `wifiscan` from any terminal, or **double‑click `wifiscan.app`** — it
reopens itself inside your terminal (iTerm if installed, else Terminal) and runs
the TUI.

## First run: grant Location Services

macOS hides Wi‑Fi **SSIDs** unless the scanning app has **Location Services**
permission. `wifiscan` ships as a signed `.app`, so it shows up in that list under
its own name:

1. Run `wifiscan` (or `wifiscan --diag`) once.
2. **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services** → enable **wifiscan**.
3. Run `wifiscan` again. `wifiscan --diag` should report **`SSIDs visible: N/N`**.

Power, channel, band, width and security all work **without** this — only the
network *names* are gated.

### Keep the grant across rebuilds (optional)

Ad‑hoc signing gives the app a new identity on every `make`, so macOS forgets the
grant and you'd have to re‑enable it. To make the grant **stick across rebuilds**,
sign with a stable self‑signed certificate:

1. **Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → Create a Certificate…**
   - Name: e.g. `wifiscan-codesign`
   - Identity Type: **Self Signed Root**
   - Certificate Type: **Code Signing**
2. Create a git‑ignored `Makefile.local`:
   ```make
   SIGN := wifiscan-codesign
   ```
3. `make` now signs with that identity. Grant Location once; every future build
   keeps it.

(The public repo defaults to ad‑hoc signing, so `make` works for everyone with no
setup.)

## Usage

```sh
wifiscan                  # interactive TUI (default)
wifiscan --once           # one scan: table + channel map + recommendations, then exit
wifiscan --json           # one scan as JSON on stdout (pipe into jq, etc.)
wifiscan --diag           # scan + permission diagnostics
wifiscan --help           # usage summary
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--once` | Single scan; print the table, channel map and recommendations, then exit. |
| `--json` | Single scan; emit a JSON array on stdout. |
| `--diag` | Print interface, permission status, network/SSID counts and the app bundle path. |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show usage. |

That's the whole flag surface — everything else is a **live** TUI control. Sort
column, band filter and refresh interval are changed with keys while running (see
[keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)), and **colour is automatic**: on in a
terminal, off when piped or redirected. Set `NO_COLOR` to force it off.

## Reading the table

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **SSID** | Network name. `‹hidden›` = a network not broadcasting its name. |
| **Chan** | Primary (control) channel number. |
| **Band** | `2.4`, `5`, or `6` GHz. |
| **Width** | Channel width in MHz: `20` / `40` / `80` / `160`. |
| **dBm** | RSSI / signal power. Closer to 0 is stronger (e.g. `-45` ≫ `-85`). |
| **Signal** | Colour bar of the same value. |
| **SNR** | Signal‑to‑noise ratio in dB — only shown for the channel your radio is tuned to (see [limitations](#known-macos-limitations)); `—` otherwise. |
| **Sec** | Security: `Open`, `WEP`, `WPA`, `WPA2`, `WPA3`, or `WPA2/3` (transition). |

**Signal colour key** (by dBm): bright‑green `≥ -50` · green `-50…-60` · yellow
`-60…-67` · orange `-67…-75` · red `< -75`.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| `0` | show all bands | | `j` / `k` | scroll down / up |
| `+` / `-` | refresh interval ± 1s | | | press a sort key again to reverse |

## The channel map

Press `g` (or `Tab`) for the congestion view. Per band, each occupied channel gets
a **power‑weighted bar** — the summed signal energy that lands on it — so crowding
is obvious at a glance:

```
 ▎ 2.4 GHz  (12 networks)
    ch 1    3ap  -48dBm  ███████
    ch 6    9ap  -34dBm  ████████████████████████████████████████
    ch 11   4ap  -36dBm  ██████████

 ▎ 5 GHz  (10 networks)
   ch 36    1ap  -49dBm  ██████████
   ch 161   3ap  -45dBm  ████████████████████████████████████████  DFS
```

`Nap` is the number of APs overlapping that channel; the dBm is the strongest of
them; the bar's **colour** tracks congestion too (green = quiet → red = busiest in
the band), so colour and length tell the same story. `DFS` marks 5 GHz channels
subject to radar detection.

## How recommendations work

1. Each AP is mapped to the **frequency span** it actually occupies, accounting for
   20 / 40 / 80 / 160 MHz channel bonding — standard 5 GHz bonded groups, the
   regular 6 GHz grid, and centre‑frequency overlap for 2.4 GHz.
2. For each candidate channel, `wifiscan` sums the **linear power** (`10^(RSSI/10)`)
   of every AP whose span overlaps it. A strong nearby AP therefore counts far more
   than a weak distant one — better than naïve "AP count" tools.
3. The channel with the **least overlapping energy** wins.

Per band:

- **2.4 GHz** → only ever recommends **1 / 6 / 11** (the non‑overlapping set).
- **5 GHz** → best **non‑DFS** channel (`36/40/44/48/149/153/157/161`), plus the
  cleanest **DFS** option marked `*` (cleaner, but can momentarily drop on radar
  detection).
- **6 GHz** → **PSC** (Preferred Scanning Channels): `5/21/37/…/229`.

## JSON output

`wifiscan --json` prints a pretty array, sorted by signal power (strongest first);
object keys are alphabetised. `noise` and `snr` are present only when macOS actually
measured them (otherwise omitted):

```jsonc
[
  {
    "band": "2.4 GHz",
    "channel": 6,
    "hidden": false,
    "rssi": -34,
    "security": "WPA2/3",
    "ssid": "home-router",
    "widthMHz": 20
  },
  {
    "band": "5 GHz",
    "channel": 161,
    "hidden": false,
    "noise": -94,
    "rssi": -45,
    "security": "WPA2/3",
    "snr": 49,
    "ssid": "home-router-5G",
    "widthMHz": 80
  }
]
```

Example — busiest 2.4 GHz channels:

```sh
wifiscan --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.band=="2.4 GHz") | "\(.channel)\t\(.ssid)"' | sort -n
```

## How it reveals SSIDs (the macOS‑26 catch)

This was the genuinely hard part. On recent macOS, CoreWLAN redacts SSIDs unless
**two** conditions both hold:

1. The app is **authorized for Location Services** (the one‑time grant above), **and**
2. The scan runs in a process launched as a real **LaunchServices app session** —
   *not* a binary spawned directly by a shell. A shell‑child process gets masked
   names **even when Location is authorized**. (This is why "wrap it in a GUI app"
   is the usual advice, and why Apple's own tools are unaffected.)

So `wifiscan` runs the actual scan in a **persistent helper instance of itself
launched via `open`** — a real LaunchServices app session:

```
open -n -g -j wifiscan.app --args --scan-daemon <control-dir>
```

`-n` new instance · `-g` don't foreground · `-j` launch hidden. The helper engages
Location **once**, then stays alive and serves each scan request over a small
atomic‑file protocol in `<control-dir>`, writing results back as JSON. The
front‑end heart‑beats the helper, so it self‑exits if the TUI quits or crashes.
Because the helper persists, refreshes after the first avoid both the process spawn
and the Location settle and are near‑instant. **No Apple Developer account and no
special entitlement are required** — only the Location grant. The full investigation
is in the commit history.

## Architecture

```
            you ── type `wifiscan` (or double-click the .app)
             │
             ▼
   ┌──────────────────────┐   scan request   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │  TUI front-end        │ ───────────────▶ │  persistent helper         │
   │  (your terminal)      │  (file protocol) │  --scan-daemon (via open)  │
   │  render · keys · sort │ ◀─────────────── │  Location (once) + CoreWLAN │
   └──────────────────────┘   JSON result     └───────────────────────────┘
        launched once via `open`, kept alive          │
        heartbeat → self-exits when the TUI quits      ▼
                                              CWWiFiClient.scanForNetworks
```

- **Front‑end** (`wifiscan` in your terminal): raw‑mode ANSI TUI — rendering, input,
  sorting, the channel map and recommendations. It does **not** need Location.
- **Helper** (`wifiscan --scan-daemon`, reached only via `open`): a long‑lived
  LaunchServices app session that engages Location once and serves each scan over a
  file protocol so SSIDs are visible. Subsequent scans skip both the process spawn
  and the Location settle, so refreshes after the first are near‑instant.
- **Double‑click**: when launched without a TTY (Finder / Spotlight / Dock), the app
  reopens itself in your terminal (iTerm if installed, else Terminal) so the TUI has
  somewhere to draw.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| All SSIDs show `‹hidden›` | Location Services not enabled for **wifiscan**. Enable it in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services, then rerun. Check with `wifiscan --diag`. |
| SSIDs were working, broke after `make` | Ad‑hoc identity changed on rebuild → grant lost. Re‑enable **wifiscan** in Location Services, or use a [stable signing cert](#keep-the-grant-across-rebuilds-optional). |
| `wifiscan --diag` shows `SSIDs visible: 0/N` | Same as above — permission. The metadata (power/channel) still works. |
| First scan takes a few seconds | Expected — the first scan launches the persistent helper and settles Location once. Subsequent refreshes reuse it and are near‑instant. |
| Double‑click prompts "wifiscan wants to control Terminal" (or iTerm) | One‑time macOS Automation prompt — click **OK**; it won't ask again. |
| `Wi‑Fi is powered off` | Turn Wi‑Fi on; the radio must be up to scan. |
| `command not found: wifiscan` | `~/.bin` isn't on your `PATH` — see [Install](#install). |

## Known macOS limitations

- **SNR shows `—` for most networks.** macOS only measures the noise floor on the
  channel your radio is currently tuned to, so neighbouring APs report noise as 0.
  RSSI + congestion are the reliable planning signals; SNR is meaningful only for
  your connected channel.
- **No BSSID or country code.** Both are gated behind Apple‑*private* entitlements
  (`com.apple.private.corewifi.bssid` / `.countrycode`) carried only by `airportd`
  and Apple's own tools (Wireless Diagnostics, `wdutil`) — a third‑party binary
  always gets `nil`, so `wifiscan` doesn't model them. Not needed for channel
  planning.

## Project layout

```
Sources/wifiscan/Core.swift   pure logic — channel plan · bonding · congestion · sorting · text layout
Sources/wifiscan/main.swift   CoreWLAN/CoreLocation · TUI · out-of-process scan helper · entrypoint
Tests/CoreTests.swift         dependency-free unit tests for Core (`make test`)
Info.plist                    app-bundle metadata + Location-Services usage string
Makefile                      `make` → signed wifiscan.app in ~/Applications + launcher; `make test`
Package.swift                 SwiftPM manifest (for editors/tooling; `make` uses swiftc)
Makefile.local                optional, git-ignored: machine-local SIGN identity
```

No third‑party dependencies — just the system **CoreWLAN**, **CoreLocation** and
**Foundation** frameworks.

## Development

```sh
make                       # build + sign + deploy
make test                  # run the core unit tests (no Xcode/XCTest needed — CLT only)
swiftc Sources/wifiscan/Core.swift Sources/wifiscan/main.swift -o /tmp/wifiscan \
    -framework CoreWLAN -framework CoreLocation     # quick type-check / compile
wifiscan --diag            # verify scanning + permission
```

Two files: **`Core.swift`** holds the pure, framework‑free logic (channel plan,
bonding model, congestion scoring, sorting, text layout) and is unit‑tested
standalone via `make test`; **`main.swift`** holds `Scanner` (CoreWLAN wrapper),
`HelperClient` / `ScanDaemon` (the persistent out‑of‑process scan), and the
raw‑mode TUI (`enterRaw` / `draw` / `runInteractive`).
